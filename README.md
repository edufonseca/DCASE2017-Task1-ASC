>  E. Fonseca, R. Gong, D. Bogdanov, O. Slizovskaia, E. Gomez and Xavier Serra. “Acoustic scene classification by ensembling gradient boosting machine and convolutional neural networks” In *Proceedings of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2017 Workshop (DCASE2017)*, Munich, Germany.

The paper presents a system that consists of the ensemble of two methods:
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

To analyse the complementarity of both methods, we provide the confusion matrixes for each of them:
